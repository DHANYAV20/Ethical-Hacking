TCP - Transmission Control Protocol which is connection oriented protocol
one is best suited when it comes to high reliability thats TCP
For eg: we have a website which  need http and https, ftp then it need TCP

UDP - User Datagram Protocol and this is a Connectionless Protocol

Something like streaming service that's connectionless, or DNS is connectionless or voiceover IP is connectionless.
